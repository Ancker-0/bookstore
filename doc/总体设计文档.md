# Bookstore

A command line bookstore system by Ancker-0. Homework for ACM class.

## Libraries

We (will) implement the following libraries

+ [`match.h`](../src/match.h): A subset of regex, to allow user queries.
+ [`fs.h`](../src/fs.h): Memory river. Provides basic file system operation.
+ [`database.h`](../src/database.h): Database, as the name suggests.
+ [`logs.h`](../src/database.h): The log system, along with pretty printing.
+ [`account.h`](../src/account.h): Provides support for account and privilege management, as well as login status.
+ [`bookstore.h`](../src/bookstore.h): The main part of bookstore.
+ [`ci.h`](../src/ci.h): Commandline interface for bookstore.

## Database schema

We have several databases: account, log system, book information.

A database has an *index* and several *fields* (both always having **fixed length**) along with a *comparation function* to compare *indices*~~, and an optional *equality function* to test the equality of two *entries*~~. An *entry* is an instance in the database, which contains corresponding *index* and *fields*. An *index* may have several corresponding *entries*.

The *index* for `account` is `UserID`. The *index* for `book` is `ISBN`. The *index* for `log` is `timestamp`.
